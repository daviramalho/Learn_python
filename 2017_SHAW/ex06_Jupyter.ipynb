    "- You will learn how to make a bunch of variables with complex strings;\n",
    "- Python knows you want something to be a string when you put either \"(double-quotes) or '(single-quotes);\n",
    "- Strings can contain any number of variables;\n",
    "- We'll be using \"f-string\" to *format* the string;\n",
    "- *\"Python also has another kind of formatting using the .format() syntax (...). You'll see me use that sometimes when I want to apply a format to an already-created string, such as in a loop.\"* **(SHAW, 2017)**\n",
    "- Practice using short, abbreviated variable names.\n",
    "- Use \",\" (comma) inside the print command to separate different variables inside the function;\n",
