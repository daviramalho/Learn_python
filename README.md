# Learn_python
This repository aims to organize the readings and tutorials on learning Python 3.x.


> I suggest you copy the "*.ipynb" files on your desktop (including its folder content, if it is the case). 
> In case you didn't install the Jupyter Notebook yet, I strongly recomend you to install the last Anaconda Package.
> You can find it here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section
> If you are not sure if you want to install the Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook right now, you can do as follows:

- Click the "*.ipynb" link on the repository's folder;
- Copy the web location that appears on your navigator (Ex: https://github.com/daviramalho/Learn_markdown/blob/master/ex_01/Learn-Markdown.ipynb);
- Go to the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) homepage.
- Paste the link to check the full rendered Jupyter Notebook file on your web browser.
